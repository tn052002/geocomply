# 1. SCOPES AND OBJECTIVES:
    - The objective of the testing is to develop a automated regression test suite to ensure that the file upload feature functions correctly, efficiently, and reliably.
    - The scope of testing includes the upload input field, the accept terms of service checkbox, the submit button, and the notification message.
    - The acceptance criteria are that the feature should upload files of different types and sizes correctly, display an error message when invalid files are uploaded, require the acceptance checkbox before uploading, and display a success message when the upload is complete.

# 2. TEST SCENARIOS
    A. Verify the upload functionality with a valid file:
    - Ensure that a file of different types and sizes can be uploaded successfully.
    - Verify that the file is uploaded correctly and can be accessed after upload.
    
    B. Verify the upload functionality with an invalid file:
    - Ensure that an invalid file cannot be uploaded, and an error message is displayed.
    - Verify that an error message is displayed when the user tries to upload files with invalid extensions, size, or other criteria.

    C. Verify that the acceptance checkbox is required before uploading a file:
    - Ensure that the checkbox is checked before uploading the file.
    - Verify that an error message is displayed if the checkbox is not checked before uploading

    D. Verify that the notification message appears after a file is uploaded:
    - Ensure that a success message is displayed when a file is uploaded successfully.
    - Verify that the notification message disappears after a short time.
    
    E. Verify that the upload feature works with large files:
    - Test the upload feature with large files, ensuring that the feature can handle files of different sizes.
    - Verify that the upload time is not too long, and the feature works efficiently with large files.

# 3. TEST DATA
    * Identify test data for valid file upload, e.g., files with different extensions, sizes, etc.
    * Identify test data for invalid file upload, e.g., files that are too large or have invalid extensions.

# 4. TEST ENVIRONMENT AND TOOLS
    - Upload feature will be available on URL: https://demo.guru99.com/test/upload/
    - Test will be performed on a Chrome browser
    - Automated test scripts will be developed in Typescript using WebdriverIO framework following Mocha BDD approach. 

# 5. TEST EXECUTION
# 5.1 Test Levels
    - Exploratory Test: The purpose of exploratory test is to identify core functionality of the file upload feature and translate them into test scenarios. 
    - Functional Test: The purpose of functional testing is to check the functions of the feature. The functional testing is carried out by feeding the input and validates the output from the application
    - Regression test: the purpose of regression testing is to ensure the feature are working properly in future releases in an automated fashion.
# 5.2 Test Execution details:
    - Create automated test cases for each of the identified test scenarios.
    - Execute the tests and record the results.
    - Address any failures or issues that arise during each level of testing.

# 6. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
    - Document the testing results, including test cases, test data, and test outcomes.
    - Automated Test report will be generated after each run.
